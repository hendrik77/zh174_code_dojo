# Hendriks ABAP Coding Dojo

ABAP katas solved TDD way. Some better, some not so much ;-) Idea: You can follow along my TDD way of solving a kata, by following the commits for each Kata.

* Hangman - following https://www.codewars.com/kata/56832fb41676465e82000030 instructions with a minor tweak... (setter instead of constructor)

## Katas in progress

## Gilded Rose
